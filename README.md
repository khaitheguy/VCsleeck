A rudimentary website template with a navigation bar created in HTML5 and CSS.

Note: If you intend to use this template, be aware that the percentage values
for the widths of the buttons on the navigation bar need to be changed according
to the number of buttons you want.

For example, if you intend to have 5 different links, the percentage value would be:
100% / 5 = 20%
