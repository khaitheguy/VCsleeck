A rudimentary website template with a navigation bar created in HTML5 and CSS.

The template itself is released under the MIT license found in the LICENSE file.

The files for the Montserrat font included comes with its own license in the OFL.txt file.

Here's a demonstration of the template: https://smolbrain.github.io/VCsleeck/

If you intend to use this template, be aware that the percentage values
for the widths of the buttons on the navigation bar need to be changed according
to the number of buttons you want.

For example, if you intend to have 5 different links, the percentage value would be:
100% / 5 = 20%
