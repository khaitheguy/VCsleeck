				<h1>We know your citizens better than you do.</h1>
				<h2>Check their vibes now.</h2>
				<p>With our brand new <em>VibeChecker&trade;</em>, we are able to "read minds" just by scanning facial expressions.</p>
				<p>Using machine learning technology, our software sends a copy of the photo to our servers where an artificial neural network
				generates a result within half a minute by comparing the facial expression against millions of other's.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="about">
				<h1>Here's how it works.</h1>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Obtain current emotional state from facial expression</li>
						<li>Determine long-term stress levels by analysing presence of blemishes on the face</li>
						<li>Identify the individual and gain acccess to other personal information* using the national database<br />
						*such as faith affliations, education level, net worth, eccentricity of hobbies**, etc.<br />
						**this includes obsession with anthromorphic animals, attraction to foreign female cartoon characters, etc.</li>
						<li>Generate an aggregated score based on these data which measures likelihood to commit crime</li>
						<li>Automatically issue arrest warrants to "high-risk" individuals</li>
						<li>Increased overall sense of security among citizens with greater obedience</li>
					</ul>

				<h1>LEGAL NOTICE</h1>
				<p>There has been a few issues which have come to our attention.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Many people, especially belligerents of this great nation, have wrongfully denounced our product as being "dystopian" or "Orwellian".<br />
					We will not tolerate anyone who disparages our product. We will not hesitate to sue for defamation if we believe that your
					remarks are harmful to our balance sheets.</li>
					<li>We are in no way affliated with the anime "Psycho-Pass" which is supposedly similar to the idea of our product. We maintain that
					the anime and our product, <em>VibeChecker&trade;</em> were both developed independently of each other. <strong>Any resemblance is purely
					coincidental.</strong>
